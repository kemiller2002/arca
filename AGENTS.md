# Agent Startup Guide

## Mission

Praxis, Echelon Foundry's repository operating system, makes research, engineering, decisions, and handoffs durable without relying on conversation history or tribal knowledge.

## Start Here

Older installations may have `./ros`, a compatibility alias of `./praxis`; new instructions use Praxis (`DF-ROS-2026-A050`).

1. Read [the governance index](docs/00-governance/README.md).
2. Identify the task's scope and operating mode.
3. Locate the applicable canonical domain records; inspect the repository and user changes before editing.
4. State or record material unknowns, constraints, assumptions, and risks.
5. Use the smallest process that preserves correctness, traceability, and continuity.
6. Execute, validate, update affected records, and leave a handoff.

Detailed rules are in the [Agent Operating Manual](docs/00-governance/Agent-Operating-Manual.md). Research packages follow the [REP Specification](docs/00-governance/Research-Execution-Package-Specification.md); engineering follows the [Engineering Standards](docs/00-governance/Engineering-Standards.md).

## Authority

Apply, in descending order: explicit user instruction; applicable safety, legal, and platform constraints; canonical governance; accepted domain REPs and theory; accepted architecture and decision records; current implementation; local convention; agent preference. A higher authority cannot authorize a violation of an applicable safety or legal constraint. When same-level sources conflict, prefer the narrower and newer accepted record and document the resolution; escalate if the outcome materially changes the authorized goal.

## Core Rules

- Never fabricate evidence, file reads, approvals, commands, test results, or certainty.
- Preserve user work. Inspect before modifying; do not destroy or irreversibly migrate without authorization.
- Make reasonable, reversible, in-scope decisions. Escalate high-impact irreversible, security/privacy-sensitive, legally ambiguous, or materially out-of-scope decisions.
- Research by testing hypotheses against confirming and falsifying evidence. Engineering by establishing a baseline, defining acceptance criteria, making the smallest robust change, and testing in proportion to risk.
- Important claims cite `EV-`, `HY-`, and `TH-` records when those records exist. Material decisions use `DF-`, which canonically means **Decision Record**.
- Do not silently change canonical policy. Propose or record the change, its evidence, consequences, version, and migration path.
- Do not claim a test passed unless it ran and passed. Name skipped or unavailable checks and their implications.
- Treat execution telemetry as evidence: discover capabilities, distinguish zero from unavailable, preserve normalized and sanitized raw provider data, prefer deterministic collection, and never invent a metric.
- Keep upstream drift bounded: start with `./praxis sync check --start`, repeat the fetch-only check whenever 30 minutes have elapsed since the last successful check, and integrate upstream changes at a safe work boundary before final validation.
- Not every edit needs a REP. Use the artifact threshold in the Agent Operating Manual.

## Handoff

For substantial work, record: objective; work completed; files changed; decisions and assumptions; tests run and results; evidence added; unresolved questions; risks; and next recommended action. A capable successor must be able to continue without the originating conversation.

## Work Protocol

Before meaningful mutation, identify the external work item and run `./praxis work begin --id ID --occurred-at TIMESTAMP` (see the F# CLI note below for the timestamp — it must be the real current time, not an arbitrary one). That transition starts an execution-telemetry record; inspect `./praxis work context ID`, classify the work, and ingest runtime telemetry that the current environment can expose. For substantial execution, use `./praxis step begin --name "..." --occurred-at TIMESTAMP` and `./praxis step complete --occurred-at TIMESTAMP` around meaningful plan units; do not create command-level noise or retroactive steps. Preserve unknown provider fields through the sanitized raw layer and record unsupported/unavailable capability explicitly. Perform the bounded work, gather configured evidence, commit and push it, record a durable checkpoint (see "Durable checkpoints and continuity" below), request a legal transition with `./praxis work complete --id ID --occurred-at TIMESTAMP --evidence TYPE=PATH` (repeatable; finalizes active telemetry), then run `./praxis registry build` and `./praxis validate`, and commit and push the resulting Praxis state. Attribute canonical records you create or change with `./praxis provenance record` (see Agent Identity and Provenance below). Use `./praxis work block --id ID --occurred-at TIMESTAMP --reason TEXT` and `./praxis work resume --id ID --occurred-at TIMESTAMP` rather than hand-editing context. Use `./praxis status` when resuming unfamiliar work. Meaningful committed changes require machine-readable attribution; see `docs/work-protocol.md` and `docs/development-telemetry.md`. If meaningful changes were committed while no work item was active, reconcile them after the fact with `./praxis work reconcile --id ID --reason TEXT --commit REV --occurred-at TIMESTAMP` (Git-evidenced, recorded as post-hoc, never a substitute for beginning work). Never touch, rewrite, or recommit files to manufacture attribution, and never create a work item only to absorb changes.

No externally-assigned ID yet? Check `./praxis work ready` for capturable, unblocked repository work before assuming none exists, and use `./praxis add "..."` to record a newly discovered obligation instead of leaving it as an unfiled comment or dropped observation (`add` does not require `--occurred-at`; it defaults to the real current time). `./praxis work start --id ID --occurred-at TIMESTAMP` (`begin` is also accepted) promotes a ready backlog item into the protocol above. This local backlog is repository-scoped triage, not a project-management system; see the "Local backlog" section of `docs/work-protocol.md`.

## Upstream synchronization and bounded drift

Long-running or stalled agents must not assume their starting view of `main`
is still current. After selecting the worktree and before meaningful mutation,
run `./praxis sync check --start`. Repeat `./praxis sync check` at coherent work
boundaries whenever 30 minutes of wall-clock time have elapsed since the last
successful check. Waiting on tools, external systems, or the user counts toward
that elapsed time. Also run it immediately before final validation and handoff.

The check performs a bounded `git fetch` of the configured upstream and writes
only per-worktree Git metadata. It never pulls, merges, rebases, switches,
stashes, resets, discards, commits, or edits working files. `./praxis sync
status` and the additive `upstreamSync` block in `./praxis status` report the
starting and current upstream commits, elapsed freshness, ahead/behind counts,
incoming and local paths, exact overlap, and whether final validation can be
claimed against the fetched upstream snapshot. A failed check does not reset
the 30-minute clock.

When upstream advanced, stop at the next safe boundary, inspect overlap, and
integrate according to the repository's branch policy while preserving user
work. Re-run affected tests after integration. Do not begin final validation
while the report is stale, unavailable, or behind. If integration is unsafe or
blocked, record the exact condition and hand off instead of forcing it. A fresh
report proves only the latest successfully fetched snapshot; no local tool can
prove that a remote did not move immediately afterward. Configure the policy at
`workProtocol.upstreamSync` in `ros.json`; repositories with no usable upstream
must disable it explicitly and record that limitation.

## Durable checkpoints and continuity

**An executor session is disposable. Repository state and Praxis state are
the continuity boundary.** No meaningful completed work may exist only in an
executor's local environment: a successor on another machine, with no access
to your filesystem, process, or conversation, must be able to continue. See
`docs/work-protocol.md` ("Durable checkpoints and continuity") and
`DF-ROS-2026-A042`.

- A **commit** is local. A **pushed commit** is on a remote. A **verified
  durable checkpoint** is Praxis's own record that your HEAD, the checkpoint
  commit, and the head of your upstream remote branch were the same commit,
  with no meaningful uncommitted work: `./praxis work checkpoint --id ID
  --occurred-at NOW --summary "what is done" --next-action "what is next"
  [--step STEP-ID]`. Praxis never commits, pushes, or stashes for you.
- A **historical checkpoint** is that record; it is never rewritten. A
  **currently recoverable checkpoint** is one the remote still carries now;
  `./praxis work context ID --text` and `./praxis status` report both, separately.
- Checkpoint at coherent recovery boundaries, not on a timer and not per
  edit: after a meaningful implementation slice or material telemetry step;
  before a risky change; before switching work items or repositories; before
  an intentional handoff; when context exhaustion or termination looks
  possible; before blocking after new work; before completing Git-backed
  work. Never create a meaningless commit to satisfy Praxis.
- For Git-backed work the order is: commit, push, `work checkpoint`,
  `work complete`, then commit and push the Praxis state (`.ros/`). Where
  `workProtocol.continuity.requireDurableCheckpoint` is set, completion
  refuses anything else, and blocking after un-checkpointed work needs a
  checkpoint or `--unrecoverable-reason TEXT` stated truthfully. Work that
  changed nothing completes as before.
- **New observability is effective-current.** Praxis preserves truthful
  historical gaps rather than restarting work or fabricating telemetry.
  Adopt step telemetry (`./praxis telemetry step start|complete|fail`) at the
  next material slice; never restart an execution or work item to gain it,
  never invent earlier steps, and never split earlier usage among steps.
  Missing historical step data is unavailable, not zero and not invalid.
- **Taking over** active work whose executor disappeared: fetch, switch to
  the checkpoint's branch in a clean checkout, then `./praxis work continue
  --id ID --occurred-at NOW` under your own identity. You get a new
  execution whose parent is the predecessor's; the predecessor is recorded
  as interrupted, never as you and never as successful. `blocked -> resume`
  remains for intentionally blocked work.

If the native Praxis executable is genuinely unavailable, use the single approved runtime-free envelope in `docs/fallback-reconciliation.md`; never hand-edit `.ros` state. Preserve only identity and telemetry the runtime actually exposes. Reconciliation is retryable: leave a pending journal/input in place and rerun rather than recreating a transaction under a new ID.

## Agent Identity and Provenance

Every agent working under this repository has an explicit, machine-readable
identity, and records it on the work it creates or changes. This applies to
every provider and runtime, and equally to humans and automation. See
[`docs/agent-provenance.md`](docs/agent-provenance.md).

1. **Establish identity once, at the start of the execution.**
   `./praxis work begin` records who you are in the execution record, and every
   later command inherits that identity.
   - A known runtime (Codex, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Copilot, GitHub
     Actions) is detected automatically.
   - Otherwise declare yourself with `PRAXIS_ACTOR_KIND`
     (`agent|human|automation`), `PRAXIS_ACTOR` (your stable agent ID),
     `PRAXIS_TELEMETRY_PROVIDER`, `PRAXIS_TELEMETRY_MODEL`, and
     `PRAXIS_TELEMETRY_RUNTIME`, or pass the matching flags on `work begin`
     (the legacy `ROS_*` names still work).
   - Check the result with `./praxis provenance identity`.
2. **Never impersonate** another agent, human, or execution. Never record work
   under an execution you did not run. Praxis refuses a contribution whose
   actor contradicts its execution.
3. **Never fabricate** a provider, model, version, session, or agent name.
   Leave an unknown value unset: Praxis records it as `unknown`, which is correct.
4. **Preserve existing provenance.** Never edit, reorder, or delete another
   contributor's `provenance` entry.
5. **Add your contribution; do not replace anyone else's.**
6. **Attribute every requirement you create**:
   `./praxis provenance record --id RQ-... --operation created`.
7. **Attribute every meaningful modification you make** to a canonical record
   (requirement, decision, evidence, hypothesis, experiment, theory,
   journal, mission, research package): `--operation modified`. Use
   `reviewed` or `approved` only for review or approval you actually
   performed.
8. **Propagate lineage** when you derive one artifact from another:
   `--derived-from SOURCE-ID`. Lineage names the source. It does not make
   the source's author an author of your artifact.
9. **Make generated evidence, findings, and results traceable** to your
   execution. Record them inside the work execution, and name supporting
   records with `--evidence`.
10. **Run `./praxis validate` before finishing.** Missing or contradictory
    provenance on new work is an error.

Identity recorded this way is provenance, not authentication. It is
self-reported and cross-checked, not cryptographically proven.

## No local runtime? Use remote execution

If you can reach this repository on GitHub but cannot run Praxis locally,
for example because there is no .NET, you are governed the same way through
typed remote requests. Follow
[`docs/remote-agent-contract.md`](docs/remote-agent-contract.md): discover
with a `praxis.describe` request, send typed operations with a stable
`requestId` and the `expectedSha` you read, and read results from the
repository.

- Remote execution is available only when
  `.github/workflows/praxis-remote.yml` exists. Remote mutation is available
  only where `ros.json` lists it under `remote.capabilities`.
- The rules above still apply: never impersonate, never fabricate identity,
  and never touch files to manufacture attribution.
- Do not work around a missing runtime by hand-editing `.ros/` state.
- Checkpoint and take over remotely with `work.checkpoint` (naming your own
  `execution.id`) and `work.continue` (protocol 1.3).
- Can commit but cannot dispatch Actions? Commit the request as
  `.praxis-inbox/<requestId>.json` on a `praxis-inbox/...` branch. The inbox
  relays it unchanged (`DF-ROS-2026-A045`).

## Lifecycle commands

Installation, verification, diagnosis and upgrade go through the standard
lifecycle interface, implemented in F#. Install the `praxis` command (with
`ros` as its compatibility alias) one of two ways (`DF-ROS-2026-A044`; npm is
no longer a distribution channel):

- **No runtime needed:** the self-contained native bundle from GitHub
  Releases (`scripts/install-native.sh`, `install-native.ps1` on Windows, or
  `echelon install praxis`); see
  [`docs/native-installation.md`](https://github.com/kemiller2002/praxis/blob/v3.7.2/docs/native-installation.md).
- **With .NET 10:** `dotnet tool install -g EchelonFoundry.Praxis`.

```
praxis init
praxis status
praxis verify
praxis upgrade
praxis doctor
```

In this source checkout the same commands are available as `./praxis init`,
`./praxis verify` and so on. `init` is idempotent, every command is
non-interactive, `--dry-run` and `--check` change nothing, and `--json` puts a
single document on stdout. Exit codes are a documented contract: `0` success,
`2` invalid arguments, `3` verification failed, `4` incompatible installation,
`5` migration blocked, `6` prerequisite failure. See
[`docs/cli.md`](https://github.com/kemiller2002/praxis/blob/v3.7.2/docs/cli.md), [`docs/installation.md`](https://github.com/kemiller2002/praxis/blob/v3.7.2/docs/installation.md)
and [`docs/upgrading.md`](https://github.com/kemiller2002/praxis/blob/v3.7.2/docs/upgrading.md).

Installation state lives in `.echelon/ros.json`; it is tool bookkeeping, not
repository work, and is never treated as a meaningful change for attribution.
Before editing a file the tool installed, check its ownership there: a
`tool-owned` file is replaced on upgrade, so a local edit belongs in a
`user-owned` or `shared` file instead.

## F# CLI

`./praxis` in this source checkout, and in every project scaffolded by
`praxis init` (both profiles), runs the F# CLI (`DF-ROS-2026-A030`,
`DF-ROS-2026-A049`).
Praxis's own repository is F#/.NET only (`RQ-ROS-2026-A024`): it owns no
JavaScript, TypeScript, npm or Node tooling, and `./praxis architecture check`
(also part of `./praxis validate` here) fails on any such file. Do not add one;
implement the behaviour in F#. In this checkout `./praxis` is a shell launcher
for the built CLI; if it reports it needs building, run
`dotnet build Praxis.slnx --configuration Release` first (CI always builds before
`./praxis` runs). In an installed project `./praxis` runs the Praxis version the
project pins, installing that native release on first use.

The command syntax is worth knowing rather than guessing from memory:

- Every mutating command shown above except `add` requires an explicit
  `--id ID` (repeatable) and `--occurred-at TIMESTAMP`, rather than a
  positional ID with an implicit clock read. **Pass the real current
  time** (e.g. `` `date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.000Z` ``), not an arbitrary
  or backdated one: a telemetry execution's own `startedAt` always reads
  the real wall clock (matching production), and a later transition whose
  supplied `--occurred-at` predates it fails `./praxis validate` with a
  spurious "capability state recording order must be chronological"
  finding — a real trap this decision's own preparation hit and diagnosed,
  not a defect to work around.
- `work start` and `work begin` are both accepted, as are `work complete`
  and `work done`.
- `work context ID` and `work show ID` take a positional ID.
- `docs/migrations/fsharp/STATUS.md` is the authoritative ledger of any
  remaining command-surface gaps (e.g. `telemetry finalize --input`, a
  deliberately unported adapter-ingestion-at-finalize path).

This section's command-syntax notes apply equally to `./praxis` in this
source checkout and to any project's own bootstrapped `./praxis`, since both
run the same F# CLI.

## Communication Engineering

Communication Engineering is installed as evidence-bounded operational guidance.
Before producing consequential communication, read:

- `.communication-engineering/COMMUNICATION-FOUNDATIONS.md`
- `.communication-engineering/COMMUNICATION-DECISION-CHECKLIST.md`
- `.communication-engineering/PURPOSE-OUTCOME-MATRIX.md`
- `.communication-engineering/COMMUNICATION-ANTI-PATTERNS.md`
- `.communication-engineering/RESEARCH-STATUS.md`

Treat research maturity as a constraint. Do not turn provisional findings into universal rules, optimize persuasion at the expense of user autonomy, or substitute style for proof obligations.
